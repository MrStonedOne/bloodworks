## Bloodworks

Bloodworks is top-down survival-action game.

You play as a soldier who tries to survive endless waves of monsters that come at him. He has many weapons at his arsenal, bonuses or perks that will help him in his fight.

Bloodworks is still in early development. Once it is finished, it will be completely free and open source. I will release the source code once it is more complete, and I would love to other to join me and help me finish it!
